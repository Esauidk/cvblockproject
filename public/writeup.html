    <h1 id="proposed-question">Proposed question</h1>
    <p>Although the main objective of this interactive visualization is to allow a user to explore the data and form
        their own questions and answers, we propose the following question as a possible question/story:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>How did the violent, property, and general crime rates per capita of 100,000 people of each American state
            change between 2000 and 2020, and how did these annual estimated rates compare between states?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h1 id="design-decisions">Design decisions</h1>
    <p>As noted, our visualization was designed to discover insights regarding the rates of violent, property, and
        general crime for each American state and how those crime rates varied between 2000 and 2020. We also thought
        that given the geospatial nature of the data and how people, ideas, and criminal resources frequently travel
        across state lines, it would be interesting to observe any geographic relationships between state crime rates.
        Our exploratory analysis of the data began with the most intuitive comparisons, those being direct, quantitative
        comparisons of the annual crime rates of the American states in our dataset, absent any geographic context -
        this led us to think of maximum and minimum rates, how we would rank the states by crime rate, and how each pair
        of states would measure up against one another. The bar chart was ideally suited for this task, as we can
        separate the nominal categories of American states and use vertical positioning/sizes of bars in a manner that
        directly supported our subconscious and perceptual inferences. Mackinlay's judgments corroborate our stance that
        comparing positional heights of the tops of bars and the sizes of bars lends well towards encoding ratio data.
        Because of this, we discovered that DC dominated all other states in all variants of crime regardless of which
        year was observed. In recognizing that DC is an outlier, we decided to eliminate it from the dataset, both so
        that differences in other state crime rate values are more pronounced, and more accurate because DC does not
        qualify as a state. These two driving factors were both present in the initial analysis and in the final US map
        that we visualized, allowing us to reach more extreme values/colors in more states that fell within a more
        limited range of crime rates - DC is also too small in land area to be noticed or hovered over on the US map
        visualization and its tooltips that we built in Vega-lite.</p>
    <p>As stated above, not only did we want to compare crime rate quantities/ratios between states, but we wanted to do
        so along a temporal dimension in a way that also reflects geospatial relationships. The average individual is
        familiar with a geographic map, and if they're American, they are familiar with that of the United States. We
        decided that the best representation of crime rates over geographic positions was a geographic map. This aligns
        with Mackinlay's priority of position to encode nominal data, but with a quantitative crime value
        associated/tied in with each geographic position. With the position encoding occupied, the quantitative crime
        value per American state needed an encoding. We are unable to change the sizes/volumes of American states on a
        map without horribly distorting the visualization and confusing the viewer, which led us to Mackinlay's
        prescription of using color saturation to represent the intensity of crime in each state. To this end, we felt
        that crime is an inherently negative quality of society, whether it be a root problem or the symptom of another,
        so we associated this negative connotation with the color red, like the blood of victims of violent crime. We
        used darker shades of red to represent greater crime rates and lighter shades of red for lower rates, to
        maximize how intuitive our chart is - we also believe that this is reasonably accessible so that color-blind
        viewers do not need to distinguish between color hues/harmonies. The temporal aspect of the data was encoded
        through an interactive dynamic query filter. Generally, people understand the universe we inhabit to encompass
        perceivable dimensions, three that involve position, and a fourth that objects in the lower three seem to
        traverse. In this paradigm of observation, it appears that things with positions/locations change over time,
        along an axis that does not live on a positional dimension. We felt that the most intuitive way to implement
        this was with a slider over the 20 years our dataset spanned over so that it seems like the American states
        change in color over time as the timeline progresses at the user's input. This to us, represents the best, most
        perceptually intuitive and inferrable way to communicate our data, as opposed to encoding time over a positional
        axis and using a slider to represent physical locations that wouldn't make sense on a 1-dimensional axis.</p>
    <p>We further concluded that though the map is well-suited towards representing geospatial comparisons of crime
        rates between states, the direct comparisons of crime rate quantities are best made with crime rates encoded
        positionally, as Mackinlay recommends. This inspired us to maintain our bar chart in our final deliverable but
        with it synchronized with the slider and change its contents as the year variable is adjusted by the user. This
        is for the same reasons listed above. However, we decided that the bar chart should avoid confusing redundant
        encodings, and made the bar chart an appealing and professional low-contrast static red shade with no color
        encodings. Finally, in regards to the bar chart, we felt that the primary benefit of a bar chart is that we can
        compare the relative heights/crime rates between states directly and without geographic information "in the
        way". While the map had tooltips to read out numbers for each state for convenience, the values are more
        directly accessible on the bar chart since the crime rates, not the geographic locations, are the focus. This
        naturally progressed towards ranking states by crime rates for each year, so we sorted the bars by descending
        height to allow the user to smoothly view relationships between potentially physically distant states and how
        their crime rates converge and diverge from each other as they change positions along the X-axis. We considered
        the alternative of not sorting/changing the horizontal positioning of the bars between years, but felt that the
        purpose of the bar visualization is to compare states on the basis of only their crime rates, and not their
        names' lexicographical proximity; it is much more difficult to compare two bars that are similar in height when
        they are not right next to each other - we make this easier and automatic for the viewer. Initially, we were
        focused on violent crime but began to debate if we wanted to represent overall crime rates as well, and this led
        us to develop an additional dynamic query filter that allows the user to choose from a dropdown list of which
        type of crime, "violent", "property", or "all", they want to observe. This serves the viewer in answering our
        question by allowing them to view how high the bars reach in terms of the tick marks of the Y-axis for each
        crime type, and gives them an intuitive sense of how high crime rates per capita are in total, but also how much
        violent and property crime make up those cumulative values.</p>
    <h1 id="development-process">Development process</h1>
    <p>Due to familiarity through in-class activities and the plethora of examples in readings/lecture, we opted to use
        Vega-lite to build our visualizations. Furthermore, the Vega-lite API did not constrict us anyway and allowed us
        to develop with no compromises in functionality, only further reinforcing this tech-stack choice. All of our
        development was done through Observable notebooks, and the final interactive visualization (and inputs) was
        simply embedded into the final site. You can follow our development process through a series of forked
        notebooks, with this being the final iteration: <a
            href="https://observablehq.com/d/9aa4ede4d0a01c60">https://observablehq.com/d/9aa4ede4d0a01c60</a>.</p>
    <p>The development of the visualization began with Tyler fetching and transforming the data by extracting topological
        data alongside the FBI data and matching each state with its FIPS code to bind the two and begin forming a
        geographic map. This was followed by Luke who further filtered the data to eliminate null values and calculate
        per capita 100,000 crime rates. This involved a great deal of wrangling in Javascript to produce nested objects
        with the data and extrema necessary to generate a choropleth map. He then implemented the initial functional
        slider and map legend to build out a first prototype map. It was at this point that Tyler cleaned the data
        further outside of Observable, added the dynamic filter for crime types, and updated the color scheme of the
        map. Finally, in between the steps of this process, Michael formed the final sorted bar chart and drafted this
        write-up. By far the most time-consuming process was to clean and manipulate the data into a form conducive to
        generating visualizations, both while generating the map and fitting data into encodings programmatically for
        the bar chart. The overall time spent by the team was
        25 hours. Lastly, we considered additional upgrades to our
        visualization such as stacking bars to make proportions of crime types more visible and clustering/highlighting
        areas of the map with multiple states together that have similar crime rates, but these implementations were
        outside the technical scope/skill range of the group for this assignment. We reserve attempting these features
        for the final project.

    <p>Our data source was a set of aggregated statistics and estimates about crime in the United States. The data was
        formed by the FBI as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, which summarizes crimes by states using
        statistical modeling to inform missing or incomplete data.</p>
